# ActionTime
I completed this project as part of the 2019 Monmouth University School of Science Summer Research Program under the direction of Professor Cui Yu collaborating with another student Allen Lu who at the time attended High Technology High School in Lincroft, NJ. The purpose of the project was to develop a web application aimed at teaching children execution skills such as time management and on time completion of tasks through reward based learning.

The live site is compatible with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox and can be viewed here http://goals.planbook.xyz/ActionTime/public/

I have set up a demo for the purpose of showing how the application works. The site is formatted with cards that when clicked will flip over to reveal more information.

The website will then redirect you to the user homepage

You can then choose to view your current challenges by Clicking on the My Challenges card, or you can view public challenges by clicking on the Public Challenges card. Each challenge card can be clicked and it will flip to reveal more information about the challenge. You can accept challenges by clicking on one of the cards on the Public Challenges page or the Pending Challenges section of the My Challenges page. In the Current Challenges section, you can update your progress to be approved by the challenge sender.

You can also make your own challenges and send them to others. To make a challenge, you must first create a task. To create a task, go back to the homepage and click on the My Tasks card.

Then click the New Task button to add a Task. Enter the information into the fields. The total field represents the total number of units required to complete the task This can be time, or if the task involves reading a book for example, it can be number of pages or chapters. The occurrence field represents how often the task should be completed, and the suggested split field represents the number of increments that the task can be split in to. You can also upload a picture to represent the new task.

Before you can challenge someone to complete a task, you must first create a reward that will be received after the challenge is complete. To create a reward go back to the homepage and click on the Rewards card.

You are now ready to challenge someone with the task that you previously created. Go back to the My Tasks page and press the Assign button on the previous task. First choose who you want to assign to the challenge. You can choose to make it public which requires approval or assign it to a group or user. For the purposes of of testing I suggest you assign it to yourself. Finally, choose a due date and type in the name of the reward that you previously created.
