# ActionTime
I completed this project as part of the 2019 Monmouth University School of Science Summer Research Program collaborating with another student who at the time attended High Technology High School in Lincroft, NJ. The purpose of the project was to develop a web application aimed at teaching children execution skills such as time management and on time completion of tasks through reward based learning.

The live site is compatible with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox and can be viewed here http://goals.planbook.xyz/ActionTime/public/

I have set up a demo for the purpose of showing how the application works. The site is formatted with cards that when clicked will flip over to reveal more information.
